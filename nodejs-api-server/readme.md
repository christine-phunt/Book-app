## Intro

This is a very small framework for building a ReSTful API server in NodeJS, using the popular ExpressJS package, modelled after the [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) paradigm.

Use this framework to get organized and running quickly, so that you can focus your time and effort where it matters, the business value of your product.

## Benefits

- It's tested: A model for writing useful unit and integration tests are included
- It's a small codebase with minimal impact, and only a few conventions. [INSERT CODE LINE COUNT HERE]
- It's documented, probably moreso than what you have already.
- It's fast! [INSERT PERF METRIC HERE]
- Simple way to manage configurations across different environments.
- A pre-built postman collection you can test with!

## Quickstart

1. Copy codebase from the `src/` folder
2. Run `npm start`

## Description

This should be a deeper description of the high level components
- Config getter
- MVC parts
