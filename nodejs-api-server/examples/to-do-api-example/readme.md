This is an implementation of the nodejs-api-server, where we build a To-Do API. This is an API that will serve the basics of a CRUD application around To-Dos.

## Tests

There are unit tests.

You can run them via `npm test`.

Most tests use the `assert` library for basic assertions and the `sinon` library for spies/stubs/mocks, and `mocha` is our test runner; nice and simple.
