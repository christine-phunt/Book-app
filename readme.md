## The Standard Pattern Libary

So what's the point of EV Patterns?

### Basics

These are examples of common problems solved by software. You might have to build one of these one day, if so, you can use this as a starting block. You can use what you find here, or ignore all of it, that's on you.

These patterns work and will get the job done. Use them as a foundation to build on.

These can be the basic building blocks that you use in your project to get going in the right direction.

**KISS - Keep it simple _silly_**: Don't make anything more complicated than it needs to be. These patterns are dead simple - and they just work.

### Quickstart

Look through these folders to see some common patterns to try and use.

Nor sure where to start? Try running the [NodeJS-API-Server](./nodejs-api-server) pattern.

### FAQ

> Does this mean I have to do my project this way?

No, you can do whatever you'd like. These are just examples of how you might build some common software structures.

> Do patterns come with tests?

Yes, it comes with a testing setup for both unit and integrationt tests, and some example tests to get yourself started.

> Is it performant?

Yes, it's pretty quick with these basic performance measures.
TODO - add performance measures....more to come

### How patterns are structured

In this repository, there is a folder for each pattern.

Inside that folder, there is a:
- `README.md` - The documentation for that pattern; what it is, how to use it, etc.
- `examples/` - Contains a bare-bones implementation of the pattern, and a more in-depth example implementation.
