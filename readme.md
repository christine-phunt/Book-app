## The Standard Pattern Libary

----

These Patterns are meant to do two things:

1. Introduce uniformity to technical appraches we use to build products
2. Uphold our code to a quality standard

My recommendation is to look through these patterns and use what you can in order to spend minimal time "setting up /  designing" overall architecture; and focus more on your business value.

More to come....

## How patterns are structured

In this repository, there is a folder for each pattern.

Inside that folder, there is a:
- `readme.md` - The documentation for that pattern; what it is, how to use it, etc
- `bare-bone-implementation/` - A working example of the pattern stripped down to it's bare bones.
- `example-implementation/` - A working example of the pattern, with additions that represent some typical use cases.
