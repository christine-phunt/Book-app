## The Standard Pattern Libary

So what's the point of EV Patterns?

## A note to contributors

Contributions are not being accepted just yet, but do not be disheartened. If you have an idea of how to make this better, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/ElephantVentures/patterns/issues) to describe your change and I'll do my best to align it to the foundational roadmap.

Contributions will be welcome and accepted soon, once the foundation of this repository, and the vision of this effort is solidifed.

### Basics

These are examples of common problems solved by software. You might have to build one of these one day, if so, you can use this as a starting block. You can use what you find here, or ignore all of it, that's on you.

These patterns work and will get the job done. Use them as a foundation to build on.

These can be the basic building blocks that you use in your project to get going in the right direction.

**KISS - Keep it simple _silly_**: Don't make anything more complicated than it needs to be. These patterns are dead simple - and they just work.

### Quickstart

Look through these folders to see some common patterns to try and use.

Not sure where to start? Try running the [NodeJS-API-Server](./nodejs-api-server) pattern.

### FAQ

> Does this mean I have to do my project this way?

No, you can do whatever you'd like. These are just examples of how you might build some common software structures.

> Do patterns come with tests?

Yes, it comes with a testing setup for both unit and integrationt tests, and some example tests to get yourself started.

> Is it performant?

Yes, it's pretty quick with these basic performance measures.
TODO - add performance measures....more to come

### How patterns are structured

In this repository, there is a folder for each pattern. Inside that folder, there is a:
- `readme.md` - The documentation for that pattern; what it is, how to use it, etc.
- `examples/` - Contains examples of implementation.

```
patterns/
    +- nodejs-api-pattern/
        +- examples/
        +- readme.md
```
