These Patterns are meant to do two things:

1. Introduce uniformity to technical appraches we use to build products
2. Uphold our code to a quality standard

My recommendation is to look through these patterns and use what you can in order to spend minimal time "setting up /  designing" overall architecture; and focus more on your business value.

More to come....
